To start creating a model, open notebooks in the jetracer file, then open interactive_regression.ipynb.
Follow the instructions and run the code with the heading ‘Camera’.
Then, change the dataset name here to what you prefer.

Run the Data Collection code and you should see a sqaure with the contents of the camera inside.
Click on the object you wish for the AI to recognise, move the camera and proceed to the next image.
Collect sufficient data by taking about 20-30 photos in various angles and directions.

Operation explanation!
The robot senses for trash bins via the camera with AI. When a bin is detected, the robot finds the most direct path to the bin calculates the best way to approach.
It first locks in on an item, proceeds forward and then rotates at the anchor to further reach the destination.
When the robot arrives, it utilises the magnets installed to attract and secure the bin onto the robot itself.
The robot then moves away, back to its original position to charge or to bring another bin back to its location.
