Project Overview

We utilize image recognition to identify a type of object and a designated location, then secure the object on a robot to transport it from its original location to the destination. 
The robot will scan around for the object using AI and find the best route to its destination. 
In our project, this is used to push a bin to a refuse collection point.


Proposed Approach

As one of the four factors of production, labour is very important, and because of a constant shortage in labour supply, we decided to create a robot in order to reduce the demand of labour in some particular industries. For example, we suggest using this robot to transport rubbish to refuse collection points. 
As we use image recognition as a base for the project, users can personalise the project by training the model themselves.
By changing to pictures supplied to change the model, the object and destination can be changed easily.


Using a camera attached to the robot, the surroundings can be scanned to find whether there is a bin nearby. 
It first locks in on the item, proceeds forward and then rotates at the anchor so that bin can be located at the front of the car. 
The magnets installed can be used to secure the bin onto the robot itself.
Then, the robot will search for the destination and calculate the quickest and most direct path to reach it.
Thus, the bin will be pushed to a refuse collection point.



To start creating a model, open notebooks in the jetracer file, then open interactive_regression.ipynb.
Follow the instructions and run the code with the heading ‘Camera’.
Then, change the dataset name here to what you prefer.

Run the Data Collection code and you should see a sqaure with the contents of the camera inside.
Click on the object you wish for the AI to recognise, move the camera and proceed to the next image.
Collect sufficient data by taking about 20-30 photos in various angles and directions.
